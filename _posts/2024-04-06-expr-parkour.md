This is the final group project for course "CMPT724 Affective Computing". We fine-tuned a transformer-based facial action units recognization model, and intergrated it into our PyGame to create a expression-controlled parkour game on PC. The game source code, script for data cleaning and model training, and documentation can be access at [my github](https://github.com/apphiaWang/expr_parkour).
