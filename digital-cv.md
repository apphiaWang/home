- Analyze the UI loading performance issue by tracing network request latencies using Edge software developers
- Troubleshot the performance of user-to-user-group mapping update API by tracing database logs in Microsoft SQL profiler and debugging with Visual Studio, and implemented the solution with C# and .Net Entity Framework, resulting in a reduction of latency by 50%
- Collaborated with peers to implement the UI of the notification system with Vue.js and Typescript, successfully delivering it as the Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
- Implemented the background process for notifying certificate status updates using .Net, C#, and RESTful API calls, successfully delivering the requested feature and ensuring customers satisfaction
- Conducted code review by addressing comments from peers and providing feedback to peers’ work with Azure DevOps to ensure readability and maintainability of code

**Research Assistant at City University of Hong Kong, Dept of Computer Science** 
<br>Hong Kong | Oct 2020 - Sep 2022
- Implemented the GutMeta platform with Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to offer scientists a solution that can analyze bioinformatics data without any coding
- Upgraded the Oviz-IDE from Vue2 to Vue3 with Vue.js and Node.js to enable Oviz developers build visualization program with ease¬ while ensuring the use of the latest techniques
- Designed the database for GutMeta by collecting requirements from PhD students and drawing relational diagram with draw.io, resulting in a clear schema for implementation
- Maintained the task management system with Flask and python to ensure smooth analysis in the lab
- Mentored undergraduates’ data visualization work by giving well-designed tutorials and answering technical questions, ensuring everyone have a smooth progress on the projects
- Maintained the Linux CentOS web server for hosting webplatforms and data pipeline tasks 
- Maintained the Oviz framework by adding features and adding documentation.
> [Oviz](https://oviz.org) is a visualization framework created by a previous RA of Prof. Li. Oviz has its own template language to describe either an SVG or a canvas chart and adopts Typescript for other functions such as data processing and interaction.

**Solution Developer at HID Global Cid Ltd.**
<br> Hong Kong |May 2019 - Sep 2020
- Collaborated with peers to implement the passport workflow management system of Libya passports with rest APIs, Java, Spring Data, MySQL, and Git, result in a production-ready application
- Mentored peers in Nigeria through the Nigerian passport production control system by giving sample RESTful API calls in JSON and demo videos on slack, successfully delivering it to production

## Main Research Projects


### 1. GutMeta

- **intro**: GutMeta is a one-stop platform for human gut metagenomics research. 
- **responsibilities**:
    - Designed the platform in collaboration with other Phd students,
    - Designed the back-end database;
    - Implemented the web platform using Ruby On Rails, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL;
    - Developed all the online visualization modules using Oviz;
    - Improved the UI using Bootstrap-Vue and TypeScript.

- **result**: The proposal is now under revision at Microbiome. The platform  is available at [gutmeta.deepomics.org](https://gutmeta.deepomics.org/visualizer/analysis/meta-overview).
> The gutmeta platform is temporarily down.

### 2. CNAHap

- **intro**: CNAHap is a germline haplotyping tool using tumor allele-specific copy number alteration. For this project, I developed the online visualization modules, including a novel compound diagram _Phased:On Genes_ and a Circos Overview chart, using the Oviz-Bio platform.
- **result**: One paper available at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.27.437314v1). The visualizations are available on bio-oviz, you can check [this post]({% post_url 2021-11-03-use-bio-oviz %}) for the guidelines.

## Competition Experience
### CombCure – an intelligent cancer clinical platform
Hong Kong | Mar 2021 - Aug 2022

> **Intro**: CombCure is a web-based platform designed for doctors. CombCure analyzes the genome sequnces of the patient (obtained from third-party sequencing organization), searches the curated database for the most appropriate medicines using our AI algorithms, and generates a report for doctors with visualized analysis results and medicine recommendation.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Act as the CTO for the project.
- Draft and amend the business proposal; present the project to the council.
- Devise the back-end system; give tutorials to intern students and direct their work on platform development; supervise the development progress.

#### **Results**
- The [project](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/start-ups/seed-fund-teams/combcure) has won the seed fund for the first cohort in [HKTech300](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/home).
- Beta version named Gene-App established, with all core functions implemented, including user management, analysis task submission, and report generation.
