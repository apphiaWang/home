## Main Research Projects


### 1. GutMeta

- **intro**: GutMeta is a one-stop platform for human gut metagenomics research. I built the webframework using Ruby On Rails and Vue.js, and developed all the visualization modules using Oviz. 
- **result**: The paper is still in preparation now. You can first have a glance at the [website here](https://gutmeta.deepomics.org/visualizer/analysis/meta-overview).

### 2. CNAHap

- **intro**: CNAHap is a germline haplotyping tool using tumor allele-specific copy number alteration. For this project, I developed the online visualization modules, including a novel compound diagram _Phased:On Genes_ and a Circos Overview chart, using the Oviz-Bio platform.
- **result**: One paper available at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.27.437314v1). The visualizations are available on bio-oviz, you can check [this post]({% post_url 2020-11-03-use-bio-oviz %}) for the guidelines.

## Competition
### CombCure â€“ an intelligent cancer clinical platform
_(Mar 2021 - Now)_

> **Intro**: CombCure is a web-based platform designed for doctors. CombCure analyzes the genome sequnces of the patient (obtained from third-party sequencing organization), searches the curated database for the most appropriate medicines using our AI algorithms, and generates a report for doctors with visualized analysis results and medicine recommendation.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Act as the CTO for the project.
- Draft and amend the business proposal; present the project to the council.
- Devise the back-end system; give tutorials to intern students and direct their work on platform development; supervise the development progress.

#### **Results**
- The [project](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/start-ups/seed-fund-teams/combcure) has won the seed fund for the first cohort in [HKTech300](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/home).
- Beta version named Gene-App established, with all core functions implemented, including user management, analysis task submission, and report generation.

## Work Experiences

**City University of Hong Kong, Dept of Computer Science** 
<br>_(Oct 2020 - Now)_
- Work as the research assistant for Professor LI Shuaicheng.
- Design database system for GutMeta website.
- Develop and maintain the websites for academic research achievements using Ruby On Rails, Postgresql, Vue.JS and Oviz.
- Develop and maintain data visualization modules on the web platform using Oviz.
- Develop and maintain the Oviz framework.
> [Oviz](https://oviz.org) is a visualization framework created by a previous RA of Prof. Li. Oviz has its own template language to describe either an SVG or a canvas chart and adopts Typescript for other functions such as data processing and interaction.

**HID Global Cid Ltd.**
<br>_(May 2019 - Sep 2020)_

- Developed back-end systems of the digital-security-document web application,  using Spring MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate, and Tomcat.
- Maintained the e-passport systems for Philippine and Nigeria.
- Prepared report templates using Jaspersoft studio.

**L&E Management**
<br>_(Jul 2018 - Apr 2019)_
- Developed back-end systems of the digital-security-document web applications.
- Optimized SQL queries for Philippine projects.
> At this time, I was working at HID Global, then transferred HID Global in May 2019.
