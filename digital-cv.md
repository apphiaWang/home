## Technical Experiences
**CAE Inc** 
<br>_(May 2023 - Dec 2023)_
- Worked as a **full-stack developer** in an Agile Scrum team for CAE Pelesys.
- Maintained the aviation e-learning system using C#, .Net, and Vue.js by adding features and fixing bugs to ensure the quality of the system and improve customer satisfaction
- Analyze UI loading performance issue by tracing network request latencies with Edge software developers
- Troubleshot the performance of user-to-user-group mapping update API by tracing database logs in Microsoft SQL profiler and debugging with Visual Studio, and implemented the solution with C# and .Net Entity Framework, resulting in a reduction of latency by 50%
- Collaborated with peers to implement the UI of the notification system with Vue.js and Typescript, successfully delivering it as the Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
- Implemented the background process for notifying certificate status updates using .Net, C#, and RESTful API calls, successfully delivering the requested feature and ensuring customers satisfaction
- Conducted code review by addressing comments from peers and providing feedback to peers’ work with Azure DevOps to ensure readability and maintainability of code

**City University of Hong Kong, Dept of Computer Science** 
<br>_(Oct 2020 - Sep 2022)_
- Worked as a **research assistant** for Professor LI Shuaicheng.
- Implemented the GutMeta platform with Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to offer scientists a solution that can analyze bioinformatics data without any coding
- Upgraded the Oviz-IDE from Vue2 to Vue3 with Vue.js and Node.js to enable Oviz developers build visualization program with ease¬ while ensuring the use of the latest techniques
- Designed the database for GutMeta by collecting requirements from PhD students and drawing relational diagram with draw.io, resulting in a clear schema for implementation
- Maintained the task management system with Flask and python to ensure smooth analysis in the lab
- Mentored undergraduates’ data visualization work by giving well-designed tutorials and answering technical questions, ensuring everyone have a smooth progress on the projects
- Maintained the Linux CentOS web server for hosting webplatforms and data pipeline tasks 
- Maintained the Oviz framework by adding features and adding documentation.
> [Oviz](https://oviz.org) is a visualization framework created by a previous RA of Prof. Li. Oviz has its own template language to describe either an SVG or a canvas chart and adopts Typescript for other functions such as data processing and interaction.

**HID Global Cid Ltd.**
<br>_(May 2019 - Sep 2020)_
- Worked as a **junior solution developer**
- Collaborated with peers to implement the passport workflow management system of Libya passports with rest APIs, Java, Spring Data, MySQL, and Git, result in a production-ready application
- Optimized the inventory checkout query of the Philippines passport system by updating the query with batch update in MSSQL, reducing query time from an hour to a few seconds
- Mentored our peers in Nigeria through the Nigerian passport production control system by giving sample RESTful API calls in JSON and demo videos on slack, successfully delivering it to production
- Maintained the front-end of the Macao passport system by enhancing UI with Angular.js, HTML, and CSS to help officers control the passport production more efficiently
- Prepared report templates using Jaspersoft studio and MicrosoftSQL

**L&E Management** _(worked for HID)_
<br>_(Jul 2018 - Apr 2019)_
- Implemented back-end of the Myanmar Seafarer ID production control system in collaboration with the team using Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Microsoft SQL, successfully delivering them to production
- Optimized the inventory checkout query of the Philippines passport system by updating the query with batch update in MSSQL, reducing query time from an hour to a few seconds
> At this time, I was working at HID Global, then transferred HID Global in May 2019.

## Main Research Projects


### 1. GutMeta

- **intro**: GutMeta is a one-stop platform for human gut metagenomics research. 
- **responsibilities**:
    - Designed the platform in collaboration with other Phd students,
    - Designed the back-end database;
    - Implemented the webframework using Ruby On Rails, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL;
    - Developed all the online visualization modules using Oviz.

- **result**: The proposal is now under revision at Microbiome. The platform  is available at [gutmeta.deepomics.org](https://gutmeta.deepomics.org/visualizer/analysis/meta-overview).
> The gutmeta platform is temporarily down.

### 2. CNAHap

- **intro**: CNAHap is a germline haplotyping tool using tumor allele-specific copy number alteration. For this project, I developed the online visualization modules, including a novel compound diagram _Phased:On Genes_ and a Circos Overview chart, using the Oviz-Bio platform.
- **result**: One paper available at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.27.437314v1). The visualizations are available on bio-oviz, you can check [this post]({% post_url 2021-11-03-use-bio-oviz %}) for the guidelines.

## Competition
### CombCure – an intelligent cancer clinical platform
_(Mar 2021 - Now)_

> **Intro**: CombCure is a web-based platform designed for doctors. CombCure analyzes the genome sequnces of the patient (obtained from third-party sequencing organization), searches the curated database for the most appropriate medicines using our AI algorithms, and generates a report for doctors with visualized analysis results and medicine recommendation.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Act as the CTO for the project.
- Draft and amend the business proposal; present the project to the council.
- Devise the back-end system; give tutorials to intern students and direct their work on platform development; supervise the development progress.

#### **Results**
- The [project](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/start-ups/seed-fund-teams/combcure) has won the seed fund for the first cohort in [HKTech300](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/home).
- Beta version named Gene-App established, with all core functions implemented, including user management, analysis task submission, and report generation.
